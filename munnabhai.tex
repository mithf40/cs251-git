\title{Munnabhai}
\begin{document}
	Murli Prasad Sharma (Sanjay Dutt), nicknamed "Munna Bhai" (literally "Brother Munna") is a bhai or gunda: a crime don in the Mumbai underworld. Given that his father had wished him to be a medical doctor, he creates the faux Sri Hari Prasad Sharma Charitable Hospital (named after his father) and pretends to live in accordance with this wish whenever his father (Sunil Dutt) and mother (Rohini Hattangadi) visit him in Mumbai.
	
	One year, however, Munna's plan goes awry when Hari meets an old acquaintance, Dr. Asthana (Boman Irani) and the two older men decide to betroth Munna to Asthana's daughter, Dr. Suman "Chinki" (Gracy Singh). At this point the truth about Munna is revealed. Asthana insults Munna's parents and calls them "fools" for being ignorant of Munna's real life. Munna's father and mother, aghast and later heartbroken, leave for their village.
	
	Munna, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and to gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Ashthana is to become a doctor. He decides to go to a medical college to obtain an MBBS degree.
